# Sign-up form
A simple sign-up webpage. This project serves as a practical application of my understanding in fundamental web development concepts, focusing on:

HTML Forms: Creating a user-friendly sign-up form with essential input fields for user registration and built-in validation.
Custom fonts: Applying custom fonts.
JavaScript Validation: Implemented basic JavaScript validation to ensure password and confirm password fields match.
CSS Styling: Applying CSS styles to enhance the form's visual appeal and user experience (UX).

## Project overview

The project consists of a basic sign-up form with input fields and a submit button. JavaScript validation checks if the password and confirm password fields are identical, preventing incorrect submissions. CSS styles are used to customize the form's appearance.
